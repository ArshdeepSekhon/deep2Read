<h1> Website for 2017-Fall-UVA-CS 6501-002 Advanced Deep Learning </h1>
<br>
<div>
This website includes a (growing) list of papers and lectures we read about deep learning and related.
Feel free to submit <a href="https://github.com/QData/deep2Read" target="_blank" >pull requests</a>
when you find my typos or have comments. The covered materials are by no means an exhaustive list, but are papers that we have read or plan to learn in our reading group.
